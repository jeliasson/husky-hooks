This npm package aims to increase the developer experience and consistency by providing a set of hooks that can be opted-in the development lifecycle. It depends on [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) for `pre-commit` and `pre-push` hooks, and a few other zero/low dependency packages.

> :warning: **Note**: This package is in development and comes with breaking changes, so move with caution.

## Setup

First, make sure you have [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) installed. See installation [here](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=manual) or refer to below quick setup.

```bash
# Install husky dependency
yarn add --dev husky

# Install husky
yarn husky install
```

Once you have husky installed, let's proceed with setting up `@jeliasson/husky-hooks` and connect it with husky's `pre-commit` and `pre-push` hooks.

```bash
# Install dependency @jeliasson/husky-hooks
yarn add --dev @jeliasson/husky-hooks

# Add package pre-commit hook
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npx @jeliasson/husky-hooks pre-commit"

# Add package pre-push hook
npx husky add .husky/pre-push "npx @jeliasson/husky-hooks pre-push"

# Create config
npx @jeliasson/husky-hooks create-config
```

Test the magic ‚ú®

```bash
# Make a new branch, create a test file, git add and commit
git checkout -b testing/jeliasson-husky-hooks
touch test.tmp
git add test.tmp
git commit -m "test(repo): keep calm and commit"
```

## Hooks

Hooks to run is defined in the configuration file `husky-hooks.config.js` that was created as part of the setup. Below is a table of available built-in hooks, followed by it's respective specific configuration. Future hooks may be created that require additional dev dependencies, not included in this package, but those will be marked.

| Name                                    | Description                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [`check-branch`](#check-branch)         | Check which git branch we're currently on, and abort if it's a protected branch.                 |
| [`check-lock-files`](#check-lock-files) | Check for package manager lock files, and abort if any are present lock file that we don't want. |

#### `check-branch`

Check which git branch we're currently on, and abort if it's a protected branch. This can be useful to make sure that commits stay away from branches that only being used for Pull Requests or CI/CD.

**Setup**

Add `check-branch` hook to `pre-commit` and/or `pre-push`.

**Config**

```js
{
  settings: {
    'check-branch': {
      // Git branches that should be protected from accidental commit or push
      protectedBranches: ['main', 'dev'],
    },
  }
}
```

#### `check-lock-files`

Check for package manager lock files, and abort if any are present lock file that we don't want. This is useful to ensure that e.g. only`yarn.lock` is present in the repository.

**Setup**

Add `check-lock-files` hook to `pre-commit` and/or `pre-push`.

**Config**

```js
{
  settings: {
    'check-lock-files': {
      // Package manager lock file that should be present in the repository
      allowLockFile: 'yarn.lock',

      // Package manager lock files that should yield a abort
      denyLockFiles: ['package-lock.json', 'pnpm-lock.yaml'],
    },
  }
}
```

## Other

**Print output**

Sometimes you may want to print the actual output of a hook, and passing `--stdout` will print the stdout of all hooks.

```bash
npx @jeliasson/husky-hooks pre-commit --stdout
```
